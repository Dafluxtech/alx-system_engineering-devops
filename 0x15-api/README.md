# 0x15. API

**Repo:** `alx-system_engineering-devops`
**Directory:** `0x15-api`

## Background Context
Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data. In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so let’s build Python scripts.

## Project Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8 style`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Gather data from an API**
  * [0-gather_data_from_an_API.py](./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py): Python script
  that returns information on the to-do list progress of a given employee ID.
  * Usage: `python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee ID>`.
  * Output: `Employee <employee name> is done with tasks(<# completed tasks>/<total # tasks>):`

* **1. Export to CSV**
  * [1-export_to_CSV.py](./1-export_to_CSV.py): Python script exports to-do list
  information of a given employee ID to CSV format.
  * Usage: `python3 1-export_to_CSV.py <employee ID>`
  * File name: `<user id>.csv`.
  * Format: `"<user id>","<username>","<task completed status>","<task title>"`.

* **2. Export to JSON**
  * [2-export_to_JSON.py](./2-export_to_JSON.py): Python script that exports
  to-do list information of a given employee ID to JSON format.
  * Usage: `python3 2-export_to_JSON.py <employee ID>`
  * File name: `<user id>.json`
  * Format: `{ "<user id>": [ {"task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>, "username": "<username>"}}, ... ]}`

* **3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries**
  * [3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py](./3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py):
  Python script that exports to-do list information for all employees to JSON format.
  * Usage: `python3 3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py`
  * File name: `todo_all_employees.json`
  * Format: `{ "<user id>": [ {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, ... ], "<user id>": [ {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, ... ]}`
